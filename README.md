# Overview
This commandline utility allows you to pull docker images from a GitLab registry by providing a GitLab username and 
GitLab access token

## Versioning
We are following `v<major>.<minor>.<patch>` versioning convention, where:
* `<major>+1` means we changed the infrastructure and/or the major components that makes this software run. Will definitely 
  lead to breaking changes.
* `<minor>+1` means we upgraded/patched the dependencies this software relays on. Can lead to breaking changes.
* `<patch>+1` means we fixed a bug and/or added a feature. Breaking changes are not expected.
